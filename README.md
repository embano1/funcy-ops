# funcy-ops

Introduction to Functional Options in Go, presented at the Golang Leipzig
Community Meetup. Kinda "pseudo" code, which compiles but is for educational
purposes only. As usual, YMMV and it's only one "option" for building APIs ;)

Browse through the commit history to see how we evolve a typical program into
functional options.
